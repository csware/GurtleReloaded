    <h1>
        Setting up Gurtle for Google Code Hosted Projects</h1>
    <p>
        For latest information, see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/w/list">online documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The purpose of Gurtle is to allow you to easily access the list of issues in your
        <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">projects hosted at Google Code</a> 
        when performing a commit using TortoiseSVN. From
        within the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-commit.html#tsvn-dug-commit-basics">Commit dialog box</a>, 
        you will be able to select one or more issues listed
        online. The number and summary of each selected issue will then be appended to your
        commit log message, serving as a cross-reference for the future.</p>
    <p>
        In order to enable access to issues for a project during commits, you need to configure
        TortoiseSVN and Gurtle together. The steps for this are already described in the
        TortoiseSVN documentation, under 
        &ldquo;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-settings.html#tsvn-dug-settings-hooks-issuetracker">Issue Tracker Integration</a>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        When you see the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-settings.html#tsvn-dug-settings-hooks-issuetracker">Issue Tracker Integration/Add dialog box</a>
        appear in TortoiseSVN, you will need
        to supply three pieces of information. In the <strong>Working Copy Path</strong> field, enter the
        absolute path to the working copy of your project. From the <strong>Provider</strong> list, select
        <strong>Gurtle (Google Code)</strong>. Finally, the <strong>Parameters</strong> field should contain the following
        string, where <code>PROJECT</code> should be replaced with the name of your Google Code project:</p>
    <pre>project=PROJECT</pre>
    <p>
        For example, for this project, <em>Gurtle</em>, which is located at 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/">http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/</a>,
        the <strong>Parameters</strong> field would read <code>project=gurtle</code>.
        <em>The project name is case-sensitive so you should enter it correctly,
        usually all in lower case letters.</em></p>
    <p>
        That is it. The next you are ready to commit a change pertaining to an issue, you
        should see a button with the text <strong>Select Issue</strong> appear in the 
        Commit dialog box from TortoiseSVN.</p>
    <p>
		Alternatively, you can configure Gurtle with the Subversion properties <code>bugtraq:providerparams</code> and <code>bugtraq:provideruuid</code>.
		Set the value of the <code>bugtraq:provideruuid</code> property to <code>{91974081-2DC7-4FB1-B3BE-0DE1C8D6CE4E}</code>, which is the COM UUID of Gurtle.
		Set the value of the <code>bugtraq:providerparams</code> to the value <code>project=<em>my-google-project-name</em></code>, with <em>my-google-project-name</em> being the name
		of your Google Code project. For example, for Gurtle, this would become <code>project=gurtle</code>.</p>
